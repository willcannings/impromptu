1.2.1 - Fix bug where namespaces were not removed after camelcasing a file name
      - Simplify autoloading behaviour and fix a bug which affected autoloading
        constants while in the middle of an existing autoload.

1.2.0 - New method 'root?' which tests is symbols are prefixed with two colons
      - New 'namespace' option for folders allows you to override a components
        namespace with a namespace specific to a folder.
      - Root symbols (::A) are now respected in provides options on files.
        This allows files to implement resources which are not relative to the
        component or folder namespace. For instance a folder with a namespace
        :A containing a file which provides :B and ::C would create resources
        for A::B and C.

1.1.0 - Added support for resources which extend stdlib classes and modules
      - Added the ability to define exceptional files in a folder. Previously
        folders were either implicitly loaded (all files were loaded), or you
        could manually define which files to load. Now you can mix the two
        styles and have some files automatically loaded, and others with
        custom definitions (useful for files with exceptional names)

1.0.1 - Fix bug where nested resources were not autoloaded
      
1.0.0 - Initial Release
