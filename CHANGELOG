1.1.0 - Added support for resources which extend stdlib classes and modules
      - Added the ability to define exceptional files in a folder. Previously
        folders were either implicitly loaded (all files were loaded), or you
        could manually define which files to load. Now you can mix the two
        styles and have some files automatically loaded, and others with
        custom definitions (useful for files with exceptional names)

1.0.1 - Fix bug where nested resources were not autoloaded
      
1.0.0 - Initial Release
